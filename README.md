## 🛠 The Tech Deep Dive

- **GSAP Masterclass:** Leveraging advanced `ScrollTrigger` timelines and 3D section morphing for seamless, cinematic transitions between "Metagame Layers."
- **Omega UX Framework:** Featuring a custom-engineered magnetic cursor system and high-fidelity, performance-optimized liquid background shaders.
- **Titan Audio System:** A robust, triple-layered event hijacking architecture to ensure 100% reliable cinematic audio playback across all browsers.
- **Dynamic Immersion:** Real-time environment syncing (time-based overlays) and a persistent, high-polish achievement notification system.
